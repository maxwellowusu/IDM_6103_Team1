# Spatial Distribution on Public Infrastructure Investment in D.C.: A Bum Economy
This repository contians all the python codes for analysing the spatial distribution of public infrastructure in D.C. I

## Background
Investment in public infrastructure such as bus stops, metro stations, and schools  are vital for boosting productivity and economic development. However, investment in infrastructure sometimes results in spatial segregation of certain segments of the population. This project will assess the spatial distribution on public infrastructure specifically, public schools, bus stops, metro stations, street trees among race and socioeconomic groups.

## Getting started
These instructions will help to replicate the workflow

## Folder structure 
- data: contains csv and geojson. 
- output: contians output grahps 
- two scripts 
##### 1. data preprocessing 
This script is used to connects to API, downloads and processed data into census tract. save as csv and geojson. 
##### 2. modeling
This script is used for EDA, visualisation and modeling. 


## Required software and packages
pandas
geopandas
census
contextily
numpy
statsmodels
scipy
matplotlib and seaborn

## Usage

1. extract data from American Community Survey using API
2. download GIS data from Open Data Dc using API
3. Exploratory analysis and modelling
