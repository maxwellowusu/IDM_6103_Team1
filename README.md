# Spatial Distribution on Public Infrastructure Investment in D.C.: A Bum Economy
Investment in public infrastructure such as bus stops, metro stations, and schools  are vital for boosting productivity and economic development. However, investment in infrastructure sometimes results in spatial segregation of certain segments of the population. This project will assess the spatial distribution on public infrastructure specifically, public schools, bus stops, metro stations, street trees among race and socioeconomic groups.
